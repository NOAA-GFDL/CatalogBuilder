# CatalogBuilder

The GFDL Catalog Builder is a python community package ecosystem that allows users to generate data catalogs compatible with intake-esm.

Data catalogs simplify data discovery by creating customizable, extendable, and queryable catalogs.

To use the catalog builder, install the pip package by running **pip install git+https://github.com/NOAA-GFDL/CatalogBuilder.git**, clone the [github repository](https://github.com/NOAA-GFDL/CatalogBuilder), or use the [FRE command line interface](https://github.com/NOAA-GFDL/fre-cli).

For detailed information regarding the Catalog Builder, see our [project documentation site ](https://noaa-gfdl.github.io/CatalogBuilder/).
